# Dmoney-app-testing-newman
### Automated dmoney API by postmen & report generated by newman
# Postman
### 1. Postman is a good tool which we mostly use to quickly test APIs to see the result returned by them, but it's actually way more powerful than that.
### 2. Making API is hard but Postman makes it simpler,easier.
### 3. You can simply test any API and see the response immediately.
### 4. You can create a collection of API endpoints and call them whenever you want to see the responses.
